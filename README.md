# Welcome to my Readme!
Lets get Straight in towards our new Journey so without any further ado, Steps are listed below!!

# Setting up the Backend 
* Step 1 : Make a Folder { `mkdir "Your-Folder-Name"`} then --> `cd "You-Folder-Name"`.

* Step 2 : After Making sure you are inside the right Folder where you want your stuff to be present and open for use. Run --> `npm install init -y`. 

  || This is a package initializer for Your Json file and to bring reliability while development. Thus, a crucial yet easy task. ||

 * Step 3 : installing Dependencies Run --> `npm install express mongoose body-parser cors`. 
 
 || Express body-parser is an npm module used to process data sent in an HTTP request body. || 

 # Setting up the Server 
* Create a index.js file to set-up your server.
 
 || Code is available inside the Folder above! ||

 # Creating a Seprate Model For MongoDB
  Create a 'models' directory and define Todo model.
  
|| Feel Free to peek into my Code base! ||

# Creating a Routes Dir 
* Create a routes directory and define the routes for the CRUD operations.
  
# Setting up the Frontend

* Step 1 : run `npx creat-react-app client` then `cd client`

ps: I had stumbled upon an `Enoent-error` to easily fix this simply run `npm install -g npm` then follow through Step 1 again..

* Step 2 : run `npm install axios` 

|| To make HTTP requests ||

# Creating Components

* Create a components directory and add the following components: TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoForm.

* Integrate the components in the app.js 
# Run the application
Start Backend server in root directory `node index.js`
and Frontend server in client directory `npm start`

# Tech Stack and libraries used above are
* javaScript
* react.js
* express.js
* axios
* mongoDB
* cors
* body-parser
* node.js
_and the project ends here!!_
